# Software Engineering: An Open Body of Knowledge

*First public edition, July 2026.*

This is a free, openly‑licensed, continuously maintained book that teaches the
*principles and best practices* of modern software engineering: how software is built in industry using
agile methods, how to discover and analyze requirements, how to design and architect
modular systems, how to check and test code, and how to measure quality with metrics.

It is organized as **twelve chapters and a team‑project appendix**, following the topic
progression of the ACM/IEEE software‑engineering curriculum guidelines (SE2014/SEEK).[^1]
Every chapter consists of original explanatory prose rather than copied textbook
material, and is paired with a curated map of **free or openly accessible resources** —
MOOCs, university courseware, primary specifications, and papers; licenses vary and are
noted where known — so the material is **designed to support a complete
software‑engineering course**.

> **An independent open educational resource.** This is a complete, standalone book.
> Except for clearly attributed quotations and linked external resources, its explanatory
> prose, examples, diagrams, and exercises are original, and the book is released under
> Creative Commons. See [`curriculum/open-resources-map.md`](curriculum/open-resources-map.md)
> for the mapping from each chapter to complementary open materials. The prose was
> drafted with AI assistance under the author's direction, review, and fact-checking —

## Why this book exists

Most software that matters is built by **teams**, under changing requirements, with
inevitable defects, at a scale no one person can hold in their head. A university
"programming" course teaches you to write a function; a **software engineering**
course teaches you to build and evolve a *system* with other people. The discipline
is less about any single language and more about a set of enduring principles:

1. **Software is complex** → we manage complexity with design and architecture.
2. **Requirements change** → we use iterative, agile methods to adapt.
3. **Defects are inevitable** → we use reviews, static checking, and testing to catch them.
4. **Teams need coordination** → we use processes, and a healthy balance of structure and flexibility.

These four ideas thread through every chapter.

## How the book is organized

The chapters group into arcs:

| Arc | Chapters | Question it answers |
|-----|----------|---------------------|
| **Getting started** | 1–2 | What is software engineering, and what process do we use? |
| **What to build** | 3–5 | How do we discover, analyze, and specify requirements? |
| **Design & architecture** | 6–7 | How do we structure a system to tame complexity? |
| **Software quality** | 8–9 | How do we check and test that the system works? |
| **Metrics** | 10 | How do we measure quality and track progress? |
| **The AI shift** | 11 | How is AI reshaping every stage — and what stays the same? |
| **Delivery** | 12 | How does code get from a merged branch to running safely in production? |
| **Practice** | Appendix A | How do we run a real team project alongside the concepts? |

## Suggested paths through the book

- **One-semester course (14–16 weeks).** Read all twelve chapters in order, one to two
  weeks each, with the Appendix A team project running in parallel from week 2. Two
  ready-made week-by-week plans (a milestone track and a two-week-sprint track) are in
  [`curriculum/course-plan.md`](curriculum/course-plan.md).
- **One-quarter course (~10 weeks).** Keep the spine and compress: Chapters 1–2
  (week 1), 3–4 (weeks 2–3, folding Chapter 5's use-case notation into the requirements
  work), 6–7 (weeks 4–5), 8–9 (weeks 6–7), 10 (week 8), and 12 (week 9), with
  Chapter 11 read alongside each topic through its per-stage sections (§11.2). Run a
  scoped-down project: proposal, two sprints, final demo.
- **Self-study.** Read in order — every chapter ends with key takeaways, exercises, and
  free resources for going deeper. Or enter through the arc table above for a specific
  goal (Chapters 8–9 for quality practices, 12 for CI/CD); chapters cross-reference the
  earlier ideas they depend on.

## Code examples in five languages

Every code example in the book is provided in **Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, and
Ruby**, behind language tabs — pick your language once and the whole site follows
(or open any page with `?lang=go` to pre-select one). Each snippet also lives in
[`code/`](code/) as a runnable file with a test, executed by continuous integration on
every change.

The book is also available as an **EPUB and a PDF**, one edition per language —
identical prose, published with each tagged release:

## How to use this repository

- **Learners:** read the chapters in order. Each ends with *Key takeaways*, *Exercises*,
  and *Open resources* pointing to free courses and readings for deeper study.
- **Instructors:** the chapters map onto a 14–16 week semester — two ready-made plans
  (a milestone track and a two-week-sprint track) live in
  [`curriculum/course-plan.md`](curriculum/course-plan.md). Run the team project from
  Appendix A on a parallel track. Reusable document templates (idea pitch, proposal,
  sprint and status reports, team review, final report, individual write-up) are linked
  from [Appendix A](chapters/appendix-a-team-project/).
- **Contributors:** see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). This is meant to be a
  living, community‑improved resource.

## Building the book

The chapters are plain Markdown and render on GitHub as‑is. To build a browsable
website with [`mdBook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (for a PDF, print the
site's built-in print page from your browser):

```bash
cargo install mdbook mdbook-mermaid   # one-time
mdbook serve                          # live preview at http://localhost:3000
mdbook build                          # outputs static site to ./book-output
```

`SUMMARY.md` is the mdBook table of contents; `book.toml` holds configuration.

## How this book was made (AI assistance)

This book was written in collaboration with an AI assistant (Anthropic's Claude) under
the author's direction. The author set the scope, chapter progression, and course
alignment; supplied source material and corrections; fact-checked claims against the
primary sources cited in each chapter's *Open Resources* page; and edited the prose
throughout. The author has reviewed, and stands behind, every chapter. If you find an
error, please [open an issue](https://github.com/tghastings/open-swe-book/issues),
regardless of how it was introduced.

Chapter 11 teaches that professional AI use means disclosing the assistance, verifying
the output, and owning the result. This note applies that standard to the book itself.

## Citing this book

If you use this book in a course or reference it in your writing, please cite it.
GitHub's **"Cite this repository"** button (from [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff)) gives
APA and BibTeX directly, or copy the BibTeX below.

Whole book:

```bibtex
@book{hastings2026swe,
  author    = {Hastings, Thomas},
  title     = {Software Engineering: An Open Body of Knowledge},
  year      = {2026},
  publisher = {Self-published},
  url       = {https://www.swebook.org/},
  note      = {Open textbook, licensed CC BY-SA 4.0. Source:
               \url{https://github.com/tghastings/open-swe-book}}
}
```

A single chapter (adjust `title`, `chapter`, and `url`):

```bibtex
@inbook{hastings2026swe-ch12,
  author    = {Hastings, Thomas},
  title     = {Delivery: CI/CD, DevOps, and Evolution},
  booktitle = {Software Engineering: An Open Body of Knowledge},
  chapter   = {12},
  year      = {2026},
  publisher = {Self-published},
  url       = {https://www.swebook.org/chapters/12-delivery/}
}
```

The `\url` in `note` needs `\usepackage{url}` (or `hyperref`) in your LaTeX preamble;
with `biblatex` you can move it to a `urldate`/`addendum` field instead. If you use a
classic BibTeX style (`plain`, `plainnat`), swap `@inbook` for `@incollection` — those
styles ignore `booktitle` inside `@inbook`.
