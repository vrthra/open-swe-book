# §12.6.2 Characterization Tests — probe, promote the observed value, probe an edge.
# The book's step-1 probe asserts the deliberately wrong "XXX" and fails with:
#   Expected: "XXX"
#     Actual: "E10"
# Here the probe is wrapped in assert_raises so the suite stays green.
# Runs standalone: ruby characterization_tests.rb
