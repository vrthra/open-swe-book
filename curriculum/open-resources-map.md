# Open Curriculum Resource Map

This book is designed to support **a complete first undergraduate software‑engineering
course** on its own (see the [chapter → ACM/IEEE SEEK mapping](#coverage-vs-the-acmieee-seek-body-of-knowledge)
below). This map is a companion: for each chapter it lists the best **free or openly
accessible** courses, textbooks, primary sources, and videos, so learners who want more
depth — or instructors assembling a reading list — can reinforce every topic without
buying anything. **Licenses vary and are noted where known** — "free to read" is not the
same as "openly licensed"; check each before adapting.

Resources are grouped as:

- 📘 **Open textbook / notes** — full readable text, usually CC‑licensed.
- 🎓 **Course / MOOC** — university courseware or a free online course.
- 📄 **Primary source** — the canonical spec, standard, or paper.
- 🎥 **Video** — recorded lectures or talks.

> **Coverage summary.** The book's thirteen chapters cover a first course. The four
> "anchor" open courses below reinforce most of that ground; the per‑chapter tables add
> focused resources for the rest (estimation, use‑case mechanics, architectural pattern
> catalogs, and the statistics in Chapter 11).

## Coverage vs. the ACM/IEEE SEEK body of knowledge

The book is designed to support a complete *first* undergraduate SE course. The table
below maps each chapter to the knowledge areas of the ACM/IEEE **SE2014 / SEEK** guideline
so instructors can see coverage — and its limits — directly, rather than taking a "full
scope" claim on faith. SEEK is a curriculum *guideline*; no single one‑semester course
covers the whole discipline, and the "Depth" column is honest about that.

| SEEK knowledge area | Where in this book | Depth |
|---------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Professional Practice (PRF) | Ch. 1 (ethics, cases), Appendix A (teamwork) | Introductory |
| Software Process (PRO) | Ch. 2 (Scrum, XP, waterfall, V, spiral, Shape Up) | Solid |
| Requirements / Modeling & Analysis (REQ, MAA) | Ch. 3–5 (elicitation, analysis, use cases) | Solid |
| Software Design (DES) | Ch. 6–7 (modularity, UML, 4+1, patterns) | Solid |
| Software V&V (VAV) | Ch. 8–9 (reviews, static analysis, testing, coverage) | Solid |
| Software Quality (QUA) | Ch. 11 (metrics, statistics, defects) | Solid |
| Security (SEC) | **Ch. 10 (OWASP Top 10:2025, SAST/DAST/SCA, AI security testing, supply‑chain security)**; reinforced by Ch. 3 §3.7 (attack trees, STRIDE), Ch. 8 §8.4 (SAST), Ch. 13 §13.4 (security pipelines) | Solid |
| Software Construction (CST) | assumed as a prerequisite; touched in Ch. 8–9 | Light |
| Software Evolution / Maintenance | Ch. 13 §13.6 (legacy code, refactoring, technical debt); cost‑of‑change theme throughout | Introductory |
| Emerging practice: AI‑assisted SE | Ch. 12 | Introductory |
| Computing Essentials, Math & Eng. Fundamentals (CMP, FND) | assumed prerequisites | Out of scope |

## Notes on coverage & gaps

Within the areas it *does* teach, the book is self‑contained — no purchase is required to
follow the course. This map records how much of each topic *also* has strong external open
coverage, so you know where the free supplements are richest:

- **Abundant open supplements:** process/agile, requirements & user stories,
  design/modularity, code review & static analysis, testing & coverage, and all of the
  statistics in Chapter 11.
- **Thinner external coverage:** some *estimation* details (e.g. COCOMO calibration), a
  few *architectural‑pattern* treatments, and worked *case studies*. Our own chapters
  supply original explanations and examples for these.
- **Deliberately light or out of scope** (per the SEEK table above): deep software
  *construction* and the CS/math prerequisites — appropriate omissions for a one‑semester
  first course, but worth naming so no one mistakes this for the whole discipline.
  (*Maintenance/evolution* moved from this list to introductory coverage when Chapter 13
  added legacy code, refactoring, and technical debt; *security* moved to solid coverage
  when Chapter 10 added the OWASP Top 10, AI‑assisted security testing, and open‑source
  supply‑chain security.)
