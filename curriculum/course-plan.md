# Course Plans

Two ready‑to‑use schedules for a junior/senior software‑engineering course built on this
book — **Variant A**, a 15‑week milestone track, and **Variant B**, a 16‑week semester run
on two‑week sprints. Both run **two parallel tracks** (as the ACM/IEEE guidelines
recommend):

- **Concepts track** — the twelve chapters, one theme at a time.
- **Project track** — a real team project (Appendix A), started early and iterated.

The two tracks are **tightly coupled at the start** (weeks 1–4, while teams form and
scope their projects) and **loosely coupled afterward**, so each can move at its own
pace.

## Variant B: 16-week semester on two-week sprints

For courses that run the project on a two-week sprint cadence with the **dual-hat
cross-team customer model** — each team pitches an idea that *another* team builds, and
serves as customer for its own pitch (see
[Running the Project on Two-Week Sprints](../chapters/appendix-a-team-project/two-week-sprints.md)).
Concepts and project interleave: four onboarding deliverables (Sprint 0‑0 … 0‑3), then four
two-week build sprints, each ending in a **Demo Day** and a team/customer review, with a
progressive engineering-hardening arc (CI → CD → lint/dependency scans → debt paydown).

| Week | Concepts (chapter) | Project / sprint deliverable |
|------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Ch. 1 — Introduction; SaaS & the cloud (§12.1) | Think about project ideas |
| 2 | Ch. 3 — User Requirements; Shape Up (§2.8, §4.2.4) | — |
| 3 | Ch. 2 — Processes & types of agile | Teams form; **Sprint 0‑0**: idea pitches |
| 4 | Ch. 6 — Design principles | **Sprint 0‑1**: pitch swap + proposal with customer |
| 5 | Ch. 7 — Architectures + REST (§7.5.4); idea presentations | **Sprint 0‑2**: user stories + lo‑fi UI/storyboards (§3.4–3.5) |
| 6 | Ch. 9 — Testing; CI pipelines (§12.2); DORA (§12.5) | **Sprint 0‑3**: initial view, deployed |
| 7 | Demo Day; sprints & iterations (§2.2) | **Sprint 1** begins; team review #0 |
| 8 | *Test 1* | — |
| 9 | Continuous deployment (§12.3: Knight Capital, CrowdStrike) | Sprint 1 due → Demo Day; **Sprint 2**; review #1 |
| 10 | *Spring break* | — |
| 11 | Ch. 8 — Static checking; risk | Sprint 2 continues |
| 12 | Security pipelines (§12.4) | Sprint 2 due → Demo Day; **Sprint 3**; review #2 |
| 13 | Legacy code & refactoring (§12.6); Ch. 11 AI readings | Sprint 3 continues |
| 14 | Work days; Ch. 10 metrics in practice | Sprint 3 due → Demo Day; **Sprint 4**; review #3 |
| 15 | *Test 2* | Sprint 4 due |
| 16 | Final presentations | Individual write‑ups; review #4 |

Chapters 4–5 (estimation, use cases) are woven into the sprint work as read‑before
material (see the sprint table in the appendix page) rather than given lecture weeks.
Assessment shifts accordingly: sprint reports and team reviews replace the two status
reports, and two in‑term tests replace the midterm/final split.

## Assessment (suggested weights)

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|-------:|
| Team project (proposal, 2 status reports, final report, demo) | 45% |
| Individual exercises / problem sets (chapter `exercises.md`) | 20% |
| Midterm (concepts, weeks 1–7) | 15% |
| Final exam (concepts, whole book) | 20% |

## Learning outcomes

By the end, a student can:

1. Choose and run an appropriate **process** (Scrum/XP/hybrid) for a team project.
2. **Elicit, write, prioritize, and estimate** requirements as user stories/use cases.
3. **Design a modular architecture** and describe it with UML and 4+1 views.
4. Apply the right **architectural patterns** to a problem.
5. **Review and statically check** code and architecture for defects.
6. Design a **test suite** that meets defined coverage criteria.
7. Define and interpret **quality metrics** using sound statistics.
8. Work effectively on a **software team** and communicate progress.

## Adapting the plan

- **10‑week quarter:** merge weeks 4↔5 and 12↔13; move MC/DC to optional reading.
- **Bootcamp / self‑study:** follow the four anchor courses in
  [`open-resources-map.md`](open-resources-map.md) alongside the chapters; do the
  project solo or in a pair.
- **No team project:** keep the concepts track; use the checkpoints in
  [Appendix A's project exercises](../chapters/appendix-a-team-project/exercises.md) as
  larger individual assignments.
