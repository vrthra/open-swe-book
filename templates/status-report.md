# Status Report <1 | 2> — <Team / Project Name>

> **How to use this template.** Copy this file into your repository (for example,
> `docs/status-1.md`), delete these instruction blockquotes, and fill in every _italic
> prompt_. Use **Report 1** for the *skeletal system* / walking skeleton
> ([Appendix A, §A.3](../chapters/appendix-a-team-project/)) and **Report 2** for
> the *viable system* / MVP ([§A.4](../chapters/appendix-a-team-project/)). Be
> honest: graders reward a clear-eyed status over an optimistic one.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Report number | _1 (skeletal) / 2 (viable)_ |
| Team | _…_ |
| Date | _YYYY-MM-DD_ |
| How to run / try it | _URL or one-line command a grader can use_ |

## 1. Summary

_Two or three sentences: where the project stands and the single most important thing to
know since the last checkpoint._

## 2. What works right now

_Describe what a user can actually do end to end today._

- **Report 1 (skeletal):** _which single path runs end to end through every layer?_
- **Report 2 (viable):** _which must-have user stories work end to end for a real user?_

| Feature / story | Status | Evidence (link, screenshot, test) |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| _…_ | Done / Partial / Not started | _…_ |
| _…_ | | |

_Show the system as it actually is now, not as proposed. Note where reality diverged from
the plan and why (Chapters 6–7)._

_Diagram placeholder — paste a Mermaid diagram or link to `assets/diagrams/…`:_
