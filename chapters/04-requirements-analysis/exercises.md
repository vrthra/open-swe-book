# Chapter 4 — Exercises

These exercises build the judgment behind requirements analysis: sizing work, forecasting
from data, and ranking by value, cost, and risk. Tags indicate the kind of effort:
**[warm-up]** checks understanding, **[analysis]** asks you to reason or compute, and
**[project]** connects to the running team project (Appendix A). Several exercises require
real arithmetic — do the math, and show your work.

Throughout, we reuse the **clinic scheduling app** from Chapters 1 and 4.

---

### 1. Testable requirements [warm-up]

For each vague requirement below, rewrite it so it passes the §4.1 checklist — in
particular, give it a concrete **acceptance test** and name at least one dependency.

- "The app should be fast."
- "Patients should get reminders."
- "Reports should look professional."

Then explain, in one sentence each, why the original wording could not be estimated.

---

### 2. Points are not hours [warm-up]

A teammate says, "Let's just call one story point one day of work, so 5 points = 5 days."
Explain two concrete problems this creates, referring to *anchoring* (§4.2.1) and to the
reason points are deliberately *relative* (§4.2.2).

---

### 3. Spot the anchor [warm-up]

Read this exchange:

> **Lead:** "The export feature is trivial — maybe half a day?"
> **Junior dev:** "Yeah, that sounds about right, half a day."

Identify the cognitive bias at work, explain how Planning Poker's *private, simultaneous*
voting (§4.3.1) would have prevented it, and describe what the junior dev *should* have
done differently.

---

### 4. Velocity forecast [analysis]

Your team's completed points for the last four sprints were:

> Sprint 1: **19** Sprint 2: **24** Sprint 3: **21** Sprint 4: **28**

The remaining backlog totals **156 points**. Sprints are **two weeks** long.

a. Compute the average velocity.
b. Forecast the number of sprints remaining (round up) and the calendar weeks.
c. Give an *optimistic* and a *pessimistic* forecast using the fastest and slowest of the
   four sprints, and state the completion range you would tell a sponsor.
d. Mid-Sprint-5, the sponsor adds 30 points of new "must-have" work. Redo the most-likely
   forecast. In one sentence, explain what this shows about fixed-scope promises.

---

### 5. Why 90%-done counts as zero [analysis]

At sprint's end, a 13-point story is "almost finished — just needs testing." Your teammate
argues it should count as, say, 11 points toward velocity since it is nearly done. Explain
why agile counts it as **0**, and how counting partial credit would corrupt the forecast in
Exercise 4.

---

### 6. Run a Planning Poker round [analysis]

Below are the Round-1 cards four estimators played for the story *"Let patients reschedule
their own appointment online."* The scale is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

> Cards: **3, 5, 5, 13**

a. Which two estimators must explain their reasoning first, and why those two?
b. Invent a *plausible* reason the 13-player saw that the others missed, and a *plausible*
   reason the 3-player was too low. (Hint: think about consent, conflicts, notifications.)
c. Write a believable Round-2 result and the final consensus, in the style of the
   walkthrough in §4.3.1. Explain why the *conversation*, not the number, was the real
   output.

---

### 7. MoSCoW sorting [analysis]

You have a fixed release date and can clearly not finish everything. Sort these into
**Must / Should / Could / Won't-this-time**, and justify each placement in a sentence.

- Book and cancel appointments
- Detect scheduling conflicts
- Dark-mode theme
- HIPAA-compliant audit log of who viewed a record
- Waitlist with automatic promotion when a slot opens
- Multi-language interface

Then explain why keeping *Musts* to roughly 60% of the effort (§4.4.1) protects your
release date — what specifically goes wrong if 95% of the work is "Must"?

---

### 8. Value-over-cost ranking [analysis]

Rank these features by **value ÷ cost** and give the build order. Show the ratio for each.

| Feature              | Value (1–10) | Cost (pts) |
|----------------------|-------------:|-----------:|
| Waitlist auto-promote|            7 |          8 |
| Conflict detection   |            9 |          4 |
| Dark mode            |            3 |          2 |
| Insurance-card scan  |            8 |         13 |

Which feature has the highest *raw* value but does **not** rank first, and what does that
teach about "build the flashiest thing first"?

---

### 9. Add risk to the ranking [analysis]

Take the same four features from Exercise 8 and add a **risk** rating (10 = most dangerous).
The insurance-card scan needs an unfamiliar OCR service; the waitlist needs new
notification plumbing.

| Feature              | Value | Risk | Cost |
|----------------------|------:|-----:|-----:|
| Waitlist auto-promote|     7 |    6 |    8 |
| Conflict detection   |     9 |    2 |    4 |
| Dark mode            |     3 |    1 |    2 |
| Insurance-card scan  |     8 |    9 | 13   |

a. Compute the **weighted priority = (value + risk) ÷ cost** for each and give the new order.
b. Which feature moved *up* the most versus Exercise 8, and why does the formula deliberately
   promote it (§4.4.3)?
c. Argue for or against overriding the formula to build conflict detection first anyway.

---

### 10. Kano two-question survey [analysis]

For each feature, decide its Kano category (**Must-be / Performance / Attractive /
Indifferent**) and justify it using the functional/dysfunctional question pair (§4.5.1).

- The displayed appointment time is correct.
- Search returns results faster.
- A one-tap "add to my phone's calendar" button.
- The app's loading spinner is a custom animation.

Then pick one **Attractive** feature you named and argue how it might *decay* into a
Performance or Must-be feature over five years (§4.5.3).

---

### 11. COCOMO effort estimate [analysis]

Your team estimates the clinic app at **35 KLOC**. Using **Basic COCOMO**, compute the
effort in person-months for:

a. an **organic** project (a = 2.4, b = 1.05), and
b. an **embedded** project (a = 3.6, b = 1.20).

Show the arithmetic (you may use Effort = a × KLOC^b directly). Then:

c. Explain the *ratio* between the two answers in terms of both *a* and *b*.
d. The project actually grows to **70 KLOC**. Recompute the *organic* estimate and show that
   doubling the size raised effort by a factor of about **2.07**, not 2.0. Name the property
   of software this demonstrates (§4.6.1).

---

### 12. Triangulate three estimates [analysis]

For one real feature, you now have three independent estimates: Planning Poker says **8
points** (which, at your velocity of ~4 points/person-week, implies ~2 person-weeks);
COCOMO, from a KLOC guess, says **3 person-weeks**; a senior developer's gut says **1
person-week**. They disagree by 3×.

a. Rather than averaging them, what should you *do* with the disagreement (§4.6.2 pitfall)?
b. For each method, name one assumption that, if wrong, would explain its being an outlier.
c. Which single method would you trust *most* once the team has run six sprints, and why?

---

### 13. Analyze and plan your project [project]

Using your team project's current backlog (Appendix A):

a. Run five backlog items through your own version of the §4.1 checklist. Rewrite any that
   fail it.
b. Estimate all backlog items in story points using a real Planning Poker session with your
   teammates. Record one story where the *discussion* changed the estimate, and what you
   learned.
c. Build a prioritization table with columns for value, cost (points), and risk, and compute
   `(value + risk) ÷ cost`. Produce a ranked build order.
d. Classify three features with Kano's two questions and mark any **Delighter** you find.
e. If you have completed at least two sprints, compute your velocity and forecast a
   completion range for the remaining backlog. If not, produce a COCOMO estimate from a KLOC
   guess and note which you would trust more, and why.

Submit the checklist, the point estimates, the ranked table, the Kano classifications, and
the forecast, with a short paragraph on where two of your estimation methods *disagreed* and
what you did about it.
