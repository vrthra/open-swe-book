## The OWASP Top 10 and hands‑on practice

- 📄 **OWASP Top 10:2025** — [owasp.org/Top10](https://owasp.org/Top10/). The current edition of
  the industry's shared vulnerability vocabulary, with a page per category (root causes, examples,
  prevention, and mapped CWEs). Start here, then read the two or three categories most relevant to
  your project. *License: CC BY‑SA 4.0.*
- 🛠 **OWASP Juice Shop** — [owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).
  A deliberately insecure single‑page web app with 100+ challenges spanning the Top 10 and beyond;
  run it locally and try to break it. *License: MIT.*
- 🛠 **OWASP WebGoat** — [owasp.org/www-project-webgoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/).
  A deliberately insecure Java app with *guided* lessons — a gentler on‑ramp than Juice Shop for a
  first encounter with SQL injection and friends. *License: open source.*
- 🎓 **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** — [portswigger.net/web-security](https://portswigger.net/web-security).
  Free, hands‑on labs and readings from the team behind Burp Suite; the closest thing to a canonical
  free web‑security course. *Access: free; account only tracks progress.*
- 📄 **OWASP Cheat Sheet Series** — [cheatsheetseries.owasp.org](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/).
  ~150 concise, high‑value guidance pages (authentication, cryptography, cloud, AI security). The
  reference you reach for while writing a control, not while studying. *License: CC BY‑SA 4.0.*
- 📄 **OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS 5.0)** —
  [owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/).
  A checklist‑style standard for *testing* web‑application security controls at three rigor levels.
  *License: CC BY‑SA 4.0.*

## AI in security

- 🛠 **Strix — open‑source autonomous AI pentest agents** —
  [github.com/usestrix/strix](https://github.com/usestrix/strix). Agents that run a target
  dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them with proofs‑of‑concept; CLI + Docker,
  model‑agnostic, with CI/pull‑request integration. **Authorized testing only.** *License:
  Apache‑2.0.*
- 📄 **Google Project Zero — "From Naptime to Big Sleep"** —
  [projectzero.google/2024/10/from-naptime-to-big-sleep.html](https://projectzero.google/2024/10/from-naptime-to-big-sleep.html).
  The primary write‑up of the first real‑world vulnerability found by an AI agent (in SQLite).
  *Access: free.*
- 📄 **GitHub — Copilot Autofix general availability** —
  [github.blog changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-08-14-copilot-autofix-for-codeql-code-scanning-alerts-is-now-generally-available/).
  The announcement with the CodeQL‑plus‑LLM remediation numbers cited in §10.3. *Access: free.*

## The software supply chain

- 📄 **Andres Freund — "backdoor in upstream xz/liblzma"** (oss‑security, 29 Mar 2024) —
  [openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4).
  The original disclosure of the xz‑utils backdoor. Read the primary source before any blog summary.
  *Access: public mailing‑list archive.*
- 📄 **Russ Cox — "Timeline of the xz open source attack"** —
  [research.swtch.com/xz-timeline](https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline). A meticulously sourced
  timeline of the multi‑year social‑engineering campaign behind CVE‑2024‑3094. *Access: free.*
- 📄 **NVD — CVE‑2021‑44228 (Log4Shell)** —
  [nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) — and
  **CVE‑2024‑3094 (xz)** —
  [nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094). The
  authoritative records for the two case studies. *Access: U.S. government work, public domain.*
- 🛠 **OpenSSF Scorecard** — [scorecard.dev](https://scorecard.dev/). Automated checks (code review,
  branch protection, pinned dependencies, signed releases, and more) that score an open‑source
  project's security posture — the tool the chapter's Day 0 controls build on. *License: Apache‑2.0.*
- 🛠 **OWASP Dependency‑Check** —
  [owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) — and
  **Dependency‑Track** —
  [owasp.org/www-project-dependency-track](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-track/).
  Software‑composition analysis: the first scans a build for known‑vulnerable dependencies, the
  second continuously monitors an SBOM across a whole portfolio. *License: Apache‑2.0.*
- 📄 **SLSA — Supply‑chain Levels for Software Artifacts** — [slsa.dev](https://slsa.dev/). The
  framework of build/source integrity levels (L0–L3) referenced in §10.4. *License: open.*
- 🛠 **Sigstore** — [docs.sigstore.dev](https://docs.sigstore.dev/). Keyless, identity‑based signing
  of artifacts with a public transparency log — the modern answer to "who built this, and can I
  verify it?" *License: Apache‑2.0.*
- 📄 **CycloneDX** — [cyclonedx.org](https://cyclonedx.org/) — and **SPDX** —
  [spdx.dev](https://spdx.dev/). The two mainstream SBOM standards (ECMA‑424 and ISO/IEC 5962
  respectively). *License / standard: open.*
- 🎭 **MALUS** (satire) — [malus.sh](https://malus.sh/). A deadpan parody of an AI "clean‑room"
  service that claims to launder away open‑source license and attribution obligations. The joke
  makes the §10.4.2 point vivid: the open‑source supply chain runs on reciprocity, and eroding
  it is its own slow supply‑chain risk. *Read it, then read a real license.*
