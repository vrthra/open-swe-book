# Chapter 11 — Software Engineering in the Age of AI

> **Where we are.** Every previous chapter described a durable engineering discipline —
> process, requirements, design, checking, testing, metrics, teamwork. This chapter asks
> what happens to those disciplines when generative AI and **coding agents** can draft
> code, tests, requirements, and designs in seconds. We separate what genuinely changes
> from what stubbornly does not, walk the whole lifecycle stage by stage, look honestly at
> the *evidence* (which is more mixed than the marketing), and close with the **o16g
> "Outcome Engineering" manifesto** — a recent, provocative attempt to redefine the
> profession for the agentic era.

The headline claim of the moment is that AI writes the code now. The more useful claim is
this: **AI changes where the hard part lives.** For decades the bottleneck was *producing*
correct code fast enough. As producing gets cheap, the bottleneck moves to *deciding what
to build* and *proving it works* — which are the very activities this book has been
teaching. The engineer who internalized Chapters 1–10 is the person best positioned to
*direct* the agents.

## 11.1 What AI Changes — and What It Doesn't

### 11.1.1 Essential vs. accidental complexity, revisited

Recall from Chapter 1 the split between **essential** complexity (inherent in the problem)
and **accidental** complexity (from our tools and toil). Generative AI is a spectacular
weapon against *accidental* complexity: boilerplate, glue code, format conversions, first
drafts of tests, "how do I call this API" friction. It is far weaker against *essential*
complexity: deciding what the system should actually do, resolving conflicting goals,
choosing an architecture whose likely changes are cheap. That boundary is the single most
important idea in this chapter. **Delegate the toil; own the essence.**

### 11.1.2 The four pressures still hold

The book's four cross-cutting pressures do not go away — AI just shifts them:

- **Software is complex.** Agents can *generate* complexity faster than ever, including
  accidental complexity you did not ask for. Architecture (Chapters 6–7) matters *more*.
- **Requirements change.** AI lowers the cost of *responding* to change, which raises the
  premium on knowing *which* change is worth making (Chapters 3–4).
- **Defects are inevitable.** AI produces plausible-looking defects at scale. Reviews,
  static checking, and tests (Chapters 8–9) become the load-bearing walls.
- **Teams need coordination.** "Teams" now include non-human members. Coordinating a
  *swarm* of agents is a new and unsolved organizational problem (see §11.4).

### 11.1.3 A ladder of assistance: from autocomplete to agents

"AI coding" is not one thing. It helps to name the rungs, because the engineering
questions differ at each:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Autocomplete<br/>(line/block suggestions)"] --> B["Chat assistant<br/>(ask, explain, refactor)"]
    B --> C["In-IDE agent<br/>(multi-file edits, runs tools)"]
    C --> D["Autonomous agent<br/>(takes an issue → opens a PR)"]
    D --> E["Multi-agent swarm<br/>(planner + workers + critics)"]
```

As you climb the ladder, the human's job moves from *typing* toward *specifying,
supervising, and verifying* — and the cost of a confident-but-wrong output rises, because
more happens between your instruction and your review.

### 11.1.4 The productivity paradox

Does AI make developers faster? The honest answer is *it depends, and the evidence is
mixed enough to demand humility.*

- **Perceived gains are large.** In field studies, a majority of developers report feeling
  more productive with tools like GitHub Copilot, and vendors cite eye-catching
  numbers.[^1]<!-- -->[^2]
- **Measured gains are smaller and sometimes negative.** In a 2025 randomized controlled
  trial, METR had experienced open-source developers do real tasks in repositories they
  knew well. Developers *predicted* AI would make them ~24% faster; in fact they were about
  **19% slower** with AI — and still *believed* they'd been faster afterward.[^3] The slowdown
  came largely from the overhead of **reviewing and integrating** generated output. Scope
  the finding as carefully as the researchers did: it describes *that specific setting* —
  experienced developers, mature and familiar repositories, high quality standards,
  early-2025 tools — not AI-assisted work in general, and tools have moved since.

> **Principle.** Perceived productivity is not measured productivity. On familiar,
> high-standards code, the time you save typing can be swamped by the time you spend
> verifying what the agent produced. *Verification is the new bottleneck* — a theme this
> whole chapter returns to.

The lesson is not "AI is useless" — gains are real for boilerplate, unfamiliar APIs,
greenfield prototypes, and well-specified narrow tasks. The lesson is that **leverage
scales with the operator's judgment**, and that you must *measure* impact rather than trust
the feeling of speed (a direct application of Chapter 10).

## 11.2 AI Across the Lifecycle

Here we walk the lifecycle, mapping AI's role onto each chapter's discipline. For each
stage: *what AI does well now*, *where it fails*, and *what fundamental the human still
owns.*

```

### 11.2.1 Process and teamwork (Chapter 2)

AI compresses many process activities: drafting sprint plans, summarizing standups,
writing retro notes, triaging issues, generating first-pass estimates. Agents can now take
a ticket and open a pull request unattended, which strains the assumptions of Scrum and XP
— what is a "sprint" when a swarm can attempt fifty backlog items overnight?

- **Fails at:** judgment about *value* and *sequencing*; reading the human dynamics of a
  team; owning accountability for what ships.
- **Human owns:** the definition of done, the choice of what to build next, and
  responsibility. The agile principle "working software is the primary measure of progress"
  gets *sharper*, not softer — see the manifesto's "verified reality" in §11.4.[^4]

### 11.2.2 Requirements (Chapter 3)

Large language models are genuinely useful for **elicitation and drafting**: turning
interview notes, tickets, and support logs into candidate user stories, acceptance
criteria (Given/When/Then), and edge-case lists. Studies report LLM-drafted requirements
that reviewers rate as complete, consistent first drafts — comparable to an entry-level
engineer's — produced far faster and cheaper.[^5]<!-- -->[^6]

- **Fails at:** knowing what users actually *need* versus what is *plausible*; an LLM will
  cheerfully invent requirements that sound reasonable and are wrong (**hallucinated
  requirements**), and its fluency can manufacture false consensus.[^7]
- **Human owns:** talking to real stakeholders, resolving conflicting goals (Chapter 3's
  goal hierarchies), and *validating* that a story reflects a real need. Use AI to widen
  the net of candidate requirements; use humans to decide which are true.

### 11.2.3 Estimation and analysis (Chapter 4)

AI can suggest story-point estimates from historical data and surface comparable past
work. But recall *why* we estimate in Chapter 4: story points model **human uncertainty**
and drive **prioritization**, not stopwatch time. When agents do the building, the
estimation question shifts from "how many engineer-hours?" toward "how much **compute/
budget**, and is the outcome worth it?" — precisely the manifesto's *cost, not time*
reframing (§11.4). MoSCoW, value/cost/risk, and Kano analysis remain the right tools; the
"cost" axis just gets a new currency.

### 11.2.4 Use cases (Chapter 5)

Given a goal and a happy path, models are good at enumerating **alternative flows** and
exception cases — exactly the tedious part of use-case writing that people skip. That
coverage is valuable. But an agent cannot tell you which actor *goals* matter, and it will
pad use cases with flows no user will ever take.

- **Human owns:** the actor–goal list (what the system is *for*) and pruning generated
  flows down to the ones that carry real risk or value.

### 11.2.5 Design and architecture (Chapters 6–7)

This is where the human-owned layer is thickest. AI can propose class structures, generate
**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**, suggest applicable patterns from Chapter 7, and
even prototype competing designs to compare. Research on multi-agent systems that go from
requirements to candidate architectures is active but early, and leans on role
specialization to fight hallucination.[^8]<!-- -->[^9]

- **Fails at:** the *significant, expensive-to-change decisions* that define architecture
  (Chapter 6); it has no stake in your five-year maintenance cost and cannot feel the pain
  of high coupling.
- **Human owns:** modularity, coupling/cohesion trade-offs, and choosing which likely
  changes to make cheap. Let AI *draft and compare* designs; keep the *decision* and its
  rationale human and written down.

### 11.2.6 Static checking and code review (Chapter 8)

AI cuts both ways here, sharply. On one hand, AI reviewers and smarter static analyzers
catch real bugs, explain them, and suggest fixes.[^10] On the other hand, **a growing share
of code under review is now itself AI-generated** — by late 2024 Google reported more than
a quarter of its new code was — which inverts the problem from
Chapter 8: the scarce resource, *reviewer trust and attention*, is now spent on machine
output produced faster than humans can vet it.[^11]

> **Pitfall.** A 2023 controlled study found developers with an AI assistant wrote
> *less secure* code while being *more confident* it was secure — a false sense of
> safety.[^12]
> In the AI era, static analysis and human review are the brakes that make the speed
> usable.

- **Human owns:** deciding *intent and trust* (does this change do what we meant?), and
  keeping review standards from eroding under volume. Precision/recall trade-offs for
  analyzers (Chapter 8) matter more as more code flows through them.

### 11.2.7 Testing (Chapter 9)

Testing is where agentic AI has advanced most measurably. Benchmarks like **SWE-bench**
(fix a real GitHub issue) and **SWT-bench** (generate a bug-reproducing test) have driven
rapid progress in automated **test generation** and **program repair**; as of 2025, agents
resolve a substantial fraction of such benchmark issues end to end.[^13]<!-- -->[^14] Treat those numbers with
care, though: passing a benchmark's tests is *evidence*, not proof, of a correct fix —
studies of SWE-bench-style evaluation have found patches that pass the benchmark suite
while failing developer-written tests or behaving differently from the true fix, so weak
or incomplete test suites can inflate reported resolution rates (the **oracle problem**
again, wearing a benchmark's clothes).[^15] Models are also strong at
generating unit tests, property-based tests, and boundary cases (Chapter 9's black-box
techniques).[^16]

But the deepest problem in testing survives untouched: the **oracle problem**. A generated
test encodes *what the model thinks correct behavior is* — which may simply mirror a
misunderstanding also baked into the generated code. Coverage numbers can look great while
the tests assert the wrong thing.

Chapter 9's `apply_discount` makes the failure concrete: suppose the billing spec says
half-cent prices round *up*, while the generated code reaches for Python's `round` —
banker's rounding — and the generated test asserts whatever the code already returns.

```python
def apply_discount(price, percent):     # AI-generated: Python round() = banker's rounding
  return round(price * (1 - percent / 100), 2)

def test_half_off():                    # AI-generated: asserts the code's own behavior
  assert apply_discount(10.25, 50) == 5.12

test_half_off()                         # passes — and every line of the unit is covered
print(apply_discount(10.25, 50))        # 5.12; the billing spec says 5.13 (half up)
```

```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.math.RoundingMode;

public class OracleProblem {
  static double applyDiscount(double price, double percent) {
    return BigDecimal.valueOf(price * (1 - percent / 100))  // AI-generated: HALF_EVEN
        .setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN).doubleValue(); // = banker's rounding
  }

  static void testHalfOff() {  // AI-generated: asserts the code's own behavior
    if (applyDiscount(10.25, 50) != 5.12) throw new AssertionError();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    testHalfOff();  // passes — and every line of the unit is covered
    System.out.println(applyDiscount(10.25, 50)); // 5.12; the billing spec says 5.13
  }
}
```

```javascript
const assert = require("node:assert");

function applyDiscount(price, percent) {  // AI-generated: toFixed(2) rounds the stored
  return Number((price * (1 - percent / 100)).toFixed(2)); // double: 8.575 is 8.5749…
}

function testHalfOff() {                  // AI-generated: asserts the code's own behavior
  assert.strictEqual(applyDiscount(17.15, 50), 8.57);
}

testHalfOff();                           // passes — and every line of the unit is covered
console.log(applyDiscount(17.15, 50));   // 8.57; the billing spec says 8.58 (half up)
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func applyDiscount(price, percent float64) string { // AI-generated: %.2f rounds ties
	return fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", price*(1-percent/100)) // to even — banker's rounding
}

func testHalfOff() { // AI-generated: asserts the code's own behavior
	if applyDiscount(10.25, 50) != "5.12" {
		panic("testHalfOff failed")
	}
}

func main() {
	testHalfOff()                         // passes — and every line of the unit is covered
	fmt.Println(applyDiscount(10.25, 50)) // 5.12; the billing spec says 5.13 (half up)
}
```

```ruby
def apply_discount(price, percent)      # AI-generated: format %.2f rounds ties to
  format("%.2f", price * (1 - percent / 100.0))  # even — banker's rounding
end

def test_half_off                       # AI-generated: asserts the code's own behavior
  raise "test failed" unless apply_discount(10.25, 50) == "5.12"
end

test_half_off                           # passes — and every line of the unit is covered
puts apply_discount(10.25, 50)          # 5.12; the billing spec says 5.13 (half up)
```

Coverage looked great; the oracle was wrong. The suite agrees with the code because both
encode the same rounding rule, and only a reviewer who knows the billing spec can see that
`5.125` should have become `5.13`.

- **Human owns:** the **oracle** — the specification of correct behavior — and the coverage
  *criteria* that decide when testing is enough (statement/branch/MC/DC, §9.3–9.5).
  Generated tests are a starting point to be reviewed, not ground truth.

### 11.2.8 Quality and metrics (Chapter 10)

AI forces a reckoning with **what we measure**. Lines of code and commit counts were always
weak proxies; when a machine emits thousands of lines on request, they become actively
misleading. One industry analysis reports that as AI assistance spread (2021→2024), the
share of **duplicated/cloned** code rose while **refactoring** fell — a maintainability
warning sign that raw output volume hides, though it awaits independent academic
replication.[^17]

- **Human owns:** choosing metrics that resist gaming (Chapter 10's Goodhart's-Law
  discipline) and that measure **outcomes** — defect-removal efficiency, customer-found
  defects, DORA delivery metrics (Chapter 12), verified value delivered — rather than agent *activity*.
  This is the empirical backbone of Outcome Engineering (§11.4).

### 11.2.9 The team project (Appendix A)

In your own project, treat agents as fast, tireless, over-confident junior teammates. Let
them scaffold, draft tests, and explain unfamiliar code — but require the same evidence you
would from a human: a green test suite, a passing review, and a metric that moved. Record
*where* you used AI and *how you verified it*; that provenance is part of honest
engineering (and of your final report).

## 11.3 The Evidence: Productivity, Quality, Security

A balanced reading of the current research:

| Dimension | What the evidence suggests | Caveat |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------|
| **Productivity** | Real gains on boilerplate, unfamiliar APIs, greenfield, narrow well-specified tasks. | On familiar, high-standards code, a 2025 RCT found a ~19% *slowdown*; perception overstates gains.[^3] |
| **Quality** | Faster first drafts; good at tests and explanations. | Rising code duplication and falling refactoring in one industry analysis point to maintainability debt.[^17] |
| **Security** | Analyzers + AI review can catch known bug patterns. | ~40% of AI-generated programs in one study contained vulnerabilities; users felt *more* secure while being *less* so.[^18]<!-- -->[^12] |

The through-line: **AI is a power tool, and a power tool amplifies the operator.** In
skilled hands with strong verification (specs, tests, reviews, metrics), it is a real
multiplier. Without those disciplines, it multiplies *output* while quietly degrading
*quality* — and the operator won't feel it happening.

> **Principle.** In the AI era, the fundamentals in this book are not obsolete — they are
> your *verification layer*. Specs say what "correct" means; tests and reviews check it;
> metrics prove it in production. That layer is what turns fast generation into trustworthy
> software.

## 11.4 Outcome Engineering: The o16g Manifesto

In 2026, Cory Ondrejka (co-creator of Second Life; former engineering leader at Google and
Meta; CTO of Onebrief) published the **o16g manifesto** — *Outcome Engineering* — arguing
that agentic development demands a new frame.[^19]<!-- -->[^20] Its thesis: **"It was never about the
code."** Code is "the incantation transforming computation into magic," a *mechanism* for
delivering an idea. Once agents remove the constraint of human typing bandwidth, the
manifesto argues, creation is limited by the *cost of compute*, not human capacity — and the
profession should move "beyond software engineering" toward engineering **outcomes**.[^19]

It is organized around four shifts and **16 principles** in two parts.[^19] Whatever you make of
its rhetoric, its principles map with surprising directness onto the disciplines in this
book — which is itself an argument that the fundamentals endure.

**The four shifts:** *Creation not code. Cost not time. Capacity not backlog. Certainty
not vibes.*[^19]

### Part I — The Goals ("superpowered creation")

1. **The Voyage — Human Intent.** Agents explore paths; humans choose the destination.
   Don't abdicate vision to the machine. *(This book: requirements and goals, Ch. 3.)*
2. **The Truth — Verified Reality is the Only Truth.** Code is a vanity metric; grade agents
   on the verified rate of positive change delivered, not lines written. *(Testing &
   metrics, Ch. 9–10.)*
3. **The Teamwork — No More Single Player Mode.** Outcome engineering is a team sport;
   define explicit protocols for debate, decision, and delivery. *(Process, Ch. 2.)*
4. **The Liberation — The Backlog is Dead.** Never reject an idea for lack of *time*, only
   lack of *budget*; manage to cost, not capacity. *(Prioritization reframed, Ch. 4.)*
5. **The Joy — Unleash the Builders.** Write code only when it brings joy; delegate
   the toil. *(Essential vs. accidental complexity, Ch. 1.)*
6. **The Map — No Wandering in the Dark.** Never dispatch an agent without context; map the
   territory before building. *(Architecture description, Ch. 6.)*
7. **The Tech Island — Build It All.** When code is the cheapest resource, build to answer
   questions and test hypotheses. *(Prototyping to reduce risk, Ch. 2.)*
8. **The Artifacts — Failures are Artifacts.** Don't just roll back; dissect the failure and
   debug the *decision*, not only the code. *(Retrospectives & post-mortems, Ch. 2, 8.)*

### Part II — The Building ("the iron price")

9. **The Orchestration — Agentic Coordination is a New Org.** Scaling agents mirrors scaling
   people, "faster, weirder, and harder"; design the org chart for the swarm. *(Team
   structure, Ch. 2 / Appendix A.)*
10. **The Law — Code the Constitution.** Encode mission, vision, and rules into the
    environment so agents can parse intent; ambiguity is the enemy of alignment.
    *(Specifications & acceptance criteria, Ch. 3, 5.)*
11. **The Graph — All the Context, Everywhere.** Embed context into the infrastructure (a
    knowledge graph), not just the prompt. *(Architectural views & documentation, Ch. 6.)*
12. **The Order — Priorities Drive Compute.** Compute is still a cost; always know the next
    most important task. *(Value/cost/risk prioritization, Ch. 4.)*
13. **The Documentation — Show Your Work.** Code is the *what*; reasoning is the *why* —
    require agents to record discoveries and rejected paths. *(ADRs & rationale, Ch. 6.)*
14. **The Immune System — Continuous Improvement.** Repeating a mistake is a system failure;
    spend compute on the post-mortem and inoculate against recurrence. *(Process
    improvement & metrics, Ch. 2, 10.)*
15. **The Gate — Risk Stops the Line.** Make risk a *blocking* function; if risk is unknown
    or unmitigated, the line stops. *(Static checking as a quality gate, Ch. 8.)*
16. **The Validation — Audit the Outcomes.** Trust is a vulnerability; models drift, so
    continuously audit agents against the domain. *(Test adequacy & monitoring, Ch. 9–10.)*

### A reading: what's strong, what's open

**What's compelling.** The manifesto's center of gravity — *verified reality over vanity
metrics*, *outcomes over activity*, *encode intent explicitly*, *make risk a blocking
gate*, *audit continuously* — is essentially this book's quality philosophy, restated for a
world where a machine writes the first draft. Principles 2, 10, 14, 15, and 16 are almost a
summary of Chapters 8–10. That convergence is the point: **when generation is cheap,
specification and verification become the whole game.**

**What's open to challenge.** Treat it as a provocation, not gospel:

- *"The backlog is dead / cost not capacity"* assumes compute is cheap and value is easy to
  price. Prioritization under scarcity (Chapter 4) does not vanish; its currency changes.
- *"Certainty, not vibes"* is a high bar. The oracle problem (§11.2.7) means some outcomes
  remain expensive or impossible to verify automatically; "verified reality" has real
  limits.
- The **productivity paradox** (§11.1.4) cautions against assuming agents are a pure
  accelerator; the verification bottleneck can dominate.
- **Deskilling risk:** if engineers stop writing and reviewing code closely, who retains the
  judgment to *audit the outcomes*? The manifesto's own Principle 16 depends on expertise it
  could erode.

Held critically, Outcome Engineering is a useful lens: it names the shift from *producing*
software to *directing and verifying* its production — which is exactly the shift this
chapter has been describing.

## 11.5 Principles for the AI-Augmented Engineer

Synthesizing the evidence and the manifesto into working advice:

1. **Own intent and verification.** Choose the destination and define "correct"; let agents
   explore paths. You are accountable for what ships (Chapter 1's ethics do not delegate).
2. **Keep the fundamentals.** You cannot safely accept what you cannot evaluate. Understand
   the design, the tests, and the metrics well enough to catch a confident wrong answer.
3. **Shift your effort up the stack.** Spend the time AI frees on *specifying* (clear
   requirements, acceptance criteria, ADRs) and *checking* (reviews, coverage, metrics) —
   not on generating more code.
4. **Manage the new risks.** Security defects, license/provenance of generated code,
   hallucination, over-trust, and skill atrophy are now first-class engineering concerns.
5. **Measure outcomes, not activity.** Judge yourself and your agents by verified value
   delivered and defects escaped — never by lines or PR counts.

## 11.6 Conclusion

AI does not repeal the four pressures of software engineering; it *relocates* their weight.
Producing code gets cheaper, so **deciding what to build and proving it works** — the
subject of every chapter in this book — becomes the differentiator. The disciplines you
learned are promoted, not made quaint. Requirements become the prompt.
Specifications become the constitution. Tests and reviews become the trust layer over a
firehose of generated code. Metrics become the proof that an *outcome*, not just an output,
was delivered.

The o16g manifesto pushes this to its edge — *it was never about the code* — and whether or
not you accept its every claim, it points where the profession is heading: engineers who
direct fleets of agents toward well-specified, rigorously verified outcomes. That job is not
less engineering. It is *more* of the hardest, most human parts of it.
