# Chapter 5 — Exercises

Exercises are graded by depth: **[warm‑up]** checks understanding, **[analysis]** asks
you to reason.

## Concepts

1. **[warm‑up]** Define *actor*, *primary actor*, and *supporting actor* in your own
   words. For the ATM example, name one of each and say what distinguishes the primary
   from the supporting one.
2. **[warm‑up]** Explain the difference between a *goal* and a *step*. Rewrite each of
   these as a proper goal (a result in the world, not a UI action): "click the Submit
   button," "scroll to the bottom of the terms," "log in."
3. **[warm‑up]** What is the *basic flow* (main success scenario), and why do you write it
   before any alternative flow? Give the one-sentence reason in terms of what the
   alternatives depend on.
4. **[warm‑up]** Match each condition to the right structure — *specific alternative*,
   *bounded alternative*, or *extension point*: (a) the user cancels at any screen; (b) the
   entered coupon code is expired; (c) an optional gift-wrap step offered only in December.

## Analysis

5. **[analysis]** Take the ATM step *"The Cardholder enters a PIN; the system validates it
   with the Bank Authorization System."* Rewrite it once *too abstractly* and once *too
   concretely* (leaking design), then explain in a sentence what each version costs you.
6. **[analysis]** A teammate's use case has a success postcondition but no failure
   postcondition. Using the ATM's "no money out without a matching debit" guarantee as a
   model, explain why the missing failure postcondition is a real defect, and write a
   failure postcondition for a use case *Transfer Funds Between Accounts*.
7. **[analysis]** You are told to model a shared *login* step used by five different use
   cases, and an optional *apply loyalty discount* step that only applies to members
   during a sale. Decide whether each should be an `«include»` or an `«extend»`, and
   justify each choice by naming which use case depends on which.
8. **[analysis]** Critique this use-case diagram decision: a colleague has drawn arrows
   between ovals to show that "Withdraw Cash" happens *before* "Print Receipt," with a
   labeled condition on the arrow. Explain what is wrong, and state where that ordering
   and condition information actually belongs.
9. **[analysis]** Convert this user story into a full use case using the template from
   §5.3.1: *"As a patron, I want to renew a borrowed library book online so that I can
   keep it longer without visiting the branch."* Include a primary actor, at least one
   supporting actor, preconditions, a numbered basic flow, at least two alternative flows
   (one specific, one bounded), and both success and failure postconditions.
10. **[analysis]** Write a use case from scratch for **"Book a Clinic Appointment"** by an
    online patient. Produce the actor–goal list first (Pass 1), then the basic flow
    (Pass 2), then at least three alternative flows (Pass 3), labeling each as specific,
    bounded, or extended. Note explicitly which step each alternative branches from.
11. **[analysis]** Take your answer to Exercise 10 and identify one stretch of behavior it
    shares with a second plausible use case for the same clinic system (e.g., *Reschedule
    Appointment*). Factor that shared behavior into an `«include»`d use case, and show the
    single line that now replaces the shared steps in each includer.
