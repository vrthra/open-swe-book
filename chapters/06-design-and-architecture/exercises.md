# Chapter 6 — Exercises

Exercises are graded by depth: **[warm‑up]** checks understanding, **[analysis]** asks you
to reason about a design. Where an exercise asks for a diagram, a hand sketch or a
Mermaid block is fine — the thinking is what is graded.

## Concepts

1. **[warm‑up]** In your own words, explain the difference between *information hiding* and
   *encapsulation*, and give one concrete example where a language provides encapsulation
   but a design still fails at information hiding (that is, the interface leaks a secret).

2. **[warm‑up]** For each pair, say which relationship it is — association, aggregation,
   composition, generalization, or dependency — and justify the choice in one sentence:
   (a) an `Order` and the `LineItem`s that make it up and die with it; (b) a `Playlist` and
   the `Song`s it references, where songs exist independently; (c) a `SavingsAccount` and an
   `Account`; (d) a `ReportGenerator` whose `render()` method takes a `Theme` argument.

3. **[warm‑up]** Name the four "4+1" views plus the "+1," and for each write the one
   question it answers and the one stakeholder who cares most about it.

4. **[warm‑up]** Rank these couplings from worst to best and give a one-line reason for the
   worst and the best: *stamp*, *content*, *data*, *common*, *control*.

## Analysis

5. **[analysis]** You are handed a module named `Utilities` containing: `formatCurrency`,
   `parseCsvFile`, `sendEmail`, `retryWithBackoff`, and `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`. Diagnose its
   cohesion (name the type), explain the specific maintenance problems this module will
   cause, and propose a re-decomposition into cohesive modules. State the responsibility of
   each new module in a single "and"-free sentence.

6. **[analysis]** Read the following code and critique its coupling and cohesion.

   ```go
   var lastTotal = 0.0 // read by Checkout and Receipt

   type Item struct {
   	Qty               int
   	Retail, Wholesale float64
   }
   type Cart struct{ items []Item } // unexported — meant to be Cart's secret

   type PriceEngine struct{}

   func (PriceEngine) Compute(cart *Cart, isB2B bool) {
   	slices.SortFunc(cart.items, func(a, b Item) int { return a.Qty - b.Qty })
   	total := 0.0
   	for _, item := range cart.items {
   		if isB2B {
   			total += item.Wholesale * float64(item.Qty) * 0.9
   		} else {
   			total += item.Retail * float64(item.Qty)
   		}
   	}
   	lastTotal = total
   }

   // The receipt, adapted to a plain function in Go — still reads the package global.
   func RenderReceipt() string { return fmt.Sprintf("Total: $%.2f", lastTotal) }
   ```

   ```java
   class Globals { static double lastTotal = 0.0; }  // read by Checkout and Receipt

   class Item { int qty; double retail, wholesale; }
   class Cart { List<Item> items = new ArrayList<>(); }  // internals, not an interface

   class PriceEngine {
     void compute(Cart cart, boolean isB2b) {
       cart.items.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(i -> i.qty));  // sorts another object's data
       double total = 0.0;
       for (Item item : cart.items) {
         if (isB2b) {
           total += item.wholesale * item.qty * 0.9;
         } else {
           total += item.retail * item.qty;
         }
       }
       Globals.lastTotal = total;
     }
   }

   class Receipt {
     String render() { return String.format("Total: $%.2f", Globals.lastTotal); }
   }
   ```

   ```javascript
   let lastTotal = 0.0;                      // read by Checkout and Receipt

   class PriceEngine {
     compute(cart, isB2b) {
       cart._items.sort((a, b) => a.qty - b.qty);  // reaches into Cart's internals
       let total = 0.0;
       for (const item of cart._items) {
         if (isB2b) {
           total += item.wholesale * item.qty * 0.9;
         } else {
           total += item.retail * item.qty;
         }
       }
       lastTotal = total;
     }
   }

   class Receipt {
     render() { return `Total: $${lastTotal.toFixed(2)}`; }
   }
   ```

   ```python
   LAST_TOTAL = 0.0                          # read by Checkout and Receipt

   class PriceEngine:
     def compute(self, cart, is_b2b):
       global LAST_TOTAL
       cart._items.sort(key=lambda i: i["qty"])
       total = 0.0
       for item in cart._items:
         if is_b2b:
           total += item["wholesale"] * item["qty"] * 0.9
         else:
           total += item["retail"] * item["qty"]
       LAST_TOTAL = total

   class Receipt:
     def render(self):
       return f"Total: ${LAST_TOTAL:.2f}"
   ```

   ```ruby
   $last_total = 0.0                      # read by Checkout and Receipt

   class PriceEngine
     def compute(cart, is_b2b)
       items = cart.instance_variable_get(:@items)  # digs into Cart's internals
       items.sort_by! { |i| i[:qty] }
       total = 0.0
       items.each do |item|
         if is_b2b
           total += item[:wholesale] * item[:qty] * 0.9
         else
           total += item[:retail] * item[:qty]
         end
       end
       $last_total = total
     end
   end

   class Receipt
     def render = format("Total: $%.2f", $last_total)
   end
   ```

   Identify each coupling type present (there are at least three), explain the concrete
   risk of each, and rewrite the design in a paragraph so that the modules communicate
   through data coupling and depend on interfaces.

7. **[analysis]** Draw a UML **class diagram** for a small library-loan system with these
   facts: a `Member` may have zero or more `Loan`s; each `Loan` is for exactly one `BookCopy`
   and belongs to exactly one `Member`; a `BookCopy` is one physical copy of a `Book`, and a
   `Book` may have one or more `BookCopy`s that are destroyed if the `Book` record is removed;
   a `ReferenceBook` is a kind of `Book` that cannot be loaned. Show attributes with
   visibility, at least one operation per class, correct multiplicities, and use composition,
   association, and generalization at least once each. Then write two sentences explaining
   which relationships you chose composition versus aggregation for and why.

8. **[analysis]** Take the communications-app *development view* from §6.5.3. Suppose a new
   requirement arrives: messages must now be end-to-end encrypted. In which layer(s) and
   module(s) does this change belong, and why? Identify one *wrong* place to put it that
   would violate the "domain depends on nothing below it" rule, and explain the harm.

9. **[analysis]** A teammate argues that because their service "has a clean class diagram,"
   the architecture is documented. Using the structure-versus-view distinction from §6.4.2,
   explain what the class diagram does *not* tell an operations engineer or a new programmer,
   and name the two additional views you would ask them to add before you would call the
   architecture "described."

10. **[analysis]** Cyclic dependencies are called out in §6.2.3 as something to avoid. Given
    modules `Auth`, `User`, and `Notification` where `Auth` needs to notify on login,
    `Notification` needs the user's preferences from `User`, and `User` needs `Auth` to check
    permissions — draw the dependency cycle, then show how to break it by introducing one
    interface owned by the right module. Explain why your choice of interface owner matters.
